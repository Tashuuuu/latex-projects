# 🎨 Mathematical & Creative Visualizations in LaTeX

This repository showcases a collection of my projects created using **LaTeX (PStricks)** and **mathematical plotting techniques**. These works reflect a blend of logic, creativity, and symbolic reasoning — crafted during my B.Sc. Mathematics journey at University of Delhi.

## 🖌️ Projects

### 1. [Phineas in LaTeX](./Phineas-LaTeX-Art)
A full cartoon character illustration made entirely with PStricks — combining geometric primitives, vector graphics, and layers in pure LaTeX. This project demonstrates precision, patience, and creative logic.

### 2. [Mathematical Diagrams & Geometry](./Math-Diagrams)
Includes compass constructions, Venn diagrams, Pythagorean triangles, ellipse foci, and Archimedes’ area proof — all visualized using LaTeX. Ideal for math storytelling, EdTech, and educational AI.

### 3. [Function Plotting](./Function-Plots)
Advanced math plots such as:
- sin(1/x)
- √x, x²
- Parametric lemniscates
- Cardioids
- Piecewise functions

Great for mathematical modeling, data visualization, and signal behavior illustrations.

## ✍️ Tools Used

- LaTeX (PStricks)
- Mathematical reasoning
- Graph theory & geometry
- Creative plotting

## 📌 Why This Matters

While LaTeX is often seen as a typesetting tool, it can be pushed further — into a canvas for expression, mathematical exploration, and visual storytelling.

This repo reflects how logic and creativity can coexist — a mindset I now bring to my work in **AI, ML, and Data Science.**
